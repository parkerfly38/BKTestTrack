CFTestTrack
============

Testing Suite for ColdFusion

### What is CFTestTrack? ###

CFTestTrack is test case management software for QA and development teams, specifically for ColdFusion development
environments, but can be used to run Selenium tests on most other web applications as well.

### Requirements ###

1.  CF9 or above
2.  [CFSelenium] (https://github.com/teamcfadvance/CFSelenium) - FireFox plugins
3.  Selenium IDE with above mentioned FireFox plugin
4.  MXUnit
5.  MS SQL Server

### Credits and Thanks ###

This project would not be possible without the great work by Bob Silverberg on CFSelenium, and the folks that bring us MXUnit.
This project also uses Bootstrap and JQuery, without which development would have truly been a pain.
